# Darwin World
## Description
Darwin World is an evolutionary simulation game where a dynamic ecosystem evolves over time. Animals roam steppes and jungles in order to find food, evolve and reproduce. Witness the emergence of diverse species thropugh natural selection and genetic mutation.

## Technologies used
- **Language**: Application was written using Java 17
- **Libraries**: JavaFX was used for comprehensive and simple GUI

## Features
- **Dynamic Ecosystem**: An evolving world where plants grow at different rates in steppes and jungles, serving as food for the herbivorous animals.
- **Animal Life Cycle**: Animals with energy levels that must forage for food to survive, reproduce, and pass their genes to the next generation.
- **Genetic Algorithm**: Incorporates genetic variation and mutation in animal reproduction, leading to the evolution of different traits and behaviors over time.
- **Simulation Controls**: Allows pausing, resuming, and adjusting simulation parameters to observe different evolutionary outcomes.
- **Statistical Insights**: Provides real-time statistics on the ecosystem, including population dynamics, genotype prevalence, and individual animal tracking.
- **Configurations**: User can make use of one of the prepared confurations or save their own settings for further usage.
